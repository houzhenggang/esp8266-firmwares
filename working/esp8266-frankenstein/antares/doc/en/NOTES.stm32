For stm32 we have a few X-tra special make targets. 

'make list-interrupts' 
      will give you a list of interrupt vector names avaliable for
      your selected mcu. Just for a quick reference

'make probe'
      will invoke stm32flash, probe the connected mcu and patch the config
      to have the proper sizes for RAM, FLASH. It will also detect and set 
      the density/line for all STM32 devices supported with antares

Happy hacking!
