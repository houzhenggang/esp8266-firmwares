Delaylib
--------

Delaylib is implemented for most architectures and is designed to provide *surprise* delays.
Basically, it all gets down to portable delay_ms, delay_s and delay_us functions. 
Please do not rely on these for precisions. 
Normally they can take variables as arguments. 
Some architectures that support changing frequency automatically also expose a 
delaylib_set_clock function, that should be called by user when the frequency is changed.
