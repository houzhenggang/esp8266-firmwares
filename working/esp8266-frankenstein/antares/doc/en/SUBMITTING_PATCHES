Okay. you have created something, and you want to mainline that. 
Prior to sending a patch, run though this checklist: 
1. Does your patch break any of the antares_examples projects? 
   These are our test cases that should _AT LEAST_ compile. 
   You can give them a quick run using make compile in ~/.antares_examples

2. Did you test your code to actually work?

3. Do your patches follow linux kernel submitting patches guidelines? 

Tick all three and send 'em in
