0.2 GOALS
---------
* Move to kconfig-frontends instead of the current hacky system
* STM32: bump stlibs to 3.6.1 (DONE!)
* STM32: Fix ANTARES_INIT_* macros for stm32
* STM32: ANTARES_INIT_* on stm32 && -Os do not work
* STM32: STM32F4X support requires additional care
* STM32: STM32F1X USB device library (WIP!)
* STM32: STM32F4X USB device library. 
* MSP430: Find a way to get flash/ram size for target mcu at compile-time



This project is no way perfect, and there are quite a few BUGS, 
that still need to be adressed. 
If you feel like you have the guts, you can pick any of these tasks
at hand. 

* Buildsystem: The current set of Makefiles is way TOO hacky in 
  places and looks as if it was coded by "an undergrad on exess 
  coffeine" (c) Alan Cox. This should be dealt with. For now - 
  it works, so let it be. 

* Kconfig: There is a project called kconfig-frontends that has all
  the stuff needed. The current kconfig is old and bundled in a very 
  ugly fasion, so as a major milestone it should get nuked, as well as 
  gperf and bison dependencies. 

* Library code. We need MOAR library code. It should be opensource
  and PORTABLE (e.g. SDCC and GCC at the very least). Some arches, 
  like STM32 supply a whole set of library code, but that can be 
  only used only for that MCUs. Using it for anything else is 
  unethical at the very least, and breaks the license. (In case of 
  stellarisware).

* Add license-y variable to Makefiles
  A good idea is to stack licenses of the code, and provide a small
  'legal advice', on what you can and can't do with the resulting
  code, as well as give a summary of licenses involved and their
  compatibility.  

* Implement generating ARCH_HAS_XXX for different architectures.
  Just to match the linux kernel mechanism to expose things like
  antares startup code where it is supported, and hide where it
  can't be implemented technically (e.g. sdcc targets)

* Testing framework. We need a set of tests for the library code, 
  that can be used to test for regressions. 

* CLANG support. People are hypnotised by this word. We should try 
  it sometime.
